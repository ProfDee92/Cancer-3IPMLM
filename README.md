# Cancer-Investigating the Impact of the Implementation Platform on Machine Learning Models
This study investigated the impact of platform choice on the performance of machine learning models for cancer diagnosis. With cancer being a global threat, timely diagnosis is crucial, and delays have been identified as a bottleneck. Researchers have explored the development of hypothetical models using machine learning techniques to reduce diagnosis time. However, varying results have been observed when using the same dataset, prompting an examination of whether the choice of the implementation platform affects model performance. The study employs the publicly available WDBC dataset to train four algorithmsâ€”Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosted Trees (GB) on two platforms, Python SciKit-Learn, and Knime Analytics. Results revealed variations in algorithm performance, with higher accuracy generally observed in Python where GB achieved the highest accuracy at 97.37% compared to Knime where LR achieved the highest accuracy at 92.11%. The findings underscore the significance of platform selection in implementing machine learning models, emphasizing its potential impact on model efficacy and, ultimately, patient outcomes.
